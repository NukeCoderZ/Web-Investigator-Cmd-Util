Thanks to trackd on discord for fixing this for me
This is a powershell script! It will not work in command prompt!

First,run Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted

Then,add the file inside the default working directory of your terminal.

For Terminal : C:\Users\(user)  
For Terminal (Admin) : C:\Windows\System32  
For eDEX-UI : C:\Users\(user)\AppData\Roaming\eDEX-UI
